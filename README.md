you need to install npm and node js. then go to the server directory and 
run 'npm install' command then run 'node service.js' to start the nodejs server.

Make sure you have postgres running on the same port like written in the code.

for the tables on postgres don't worry the code will create them, just prepare the database andd pass the credentials into the code
